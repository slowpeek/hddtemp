* Motivation

The original hddtemp is not maintained far too long. Due to that it was removed
from the official repositories of Ubuntu (since 22.04) and Debian (since
12). This tool can be used instead to print the temps:

#+begin_example
  > sudo hddtemp-lt
  /dev/sda    WDC WD10EFRX-68FYTN0       28
  /dev/nvme0  Samsung SSD 950 PRO 256GB  40
#+end_example

* Requirements

- =smartctl= from =smartmontools= package
  - NVMe support: =smartctl= v6.5 /(Ubuntu 16.10, Debian 8 (backports))/ or higher

* Usage

#+begin_example
  hddtemp-lt [options] [disk1 ..]
#+end_example

Without any disk arguments, show temperature for all sd and nvme disks.

* Options

- =-h, --help= :: Show usage
- =-q= :: Suppress warnings
- =-V, --version= :: Show version
- =--classic= :: Replicate output format of the original hddtemp
- =--classic-tcp= :: Replicate TCP daemon output format of the original hddtemp
- =--hint path= :: Provide a file containing =smartctl --scan-open= output as a
  hint for device types (=-d= option value for =smartctl=)
- =-n, --numeric= :: Print only the temperature, unitless
- =-u, --units C|F= :: Use Celsius (default) or Fahrenheit scale

Sometimes you could see =NA= (/Not Available/) printed instead of info about
some disk. It could mean =smartctl= failed to auto-detect the connection
type. In the case, first scan your devices (it is important to use
=--scan-open=, not just =--scan=):

#+begin_example
  sudo smartctl --scan-open | tee smart-scan.txt
#+end_example

Next, feed it to the =--hint= option:

#+begin_example
  sudo hddtemp-lt --hint smart-scan.txt
#+end_example

*Notice*: It is important to keep the hint file in sync with connected disks.

By default, output is aligned into columns. Device models can contain spaces
like /WDC WD10EFRX-68FYTN0/ or /Samsung SSD 950 PRO 256GB/ so fields are
separated by at least two spaces.

When =--classic= is applied:
- output is not aligned, fields are separated by a colon followed by a space
- scale marker is added

Sample /classic/ output:

#+begin_example
  > sudo hddtemp-lt --classic
  /dev/sda: WDC WD10EFRX-68FYTN0: 28°C
  /dev/nvme0: Samsung SSD 950 PRO 256GB: 40°C
#+end_example

When =--classic-tcp= is applied:
- output is not aligned, fields are pipe separated
- there are no newlines
- units marker is a separate field

Sample /classic-tcp/ output:

#+begin_example
  > sudo hddtemp-lt --classic-tcp
  |/dev/sda|WDC WD10EFRX-68FYTN0|28|C||/dev/nvme0|Samsung SSD 950 PRO 256GB|40|C|
#+end_example

Under [[systemd][systemd/]] you can find basic systemd unit files to run a hddtemp-compatible
tcp server on port =7634=.

*Notice*: =hddtemp-lt@.service= assumes the tool is installed into
=/opt/hddtemp=.

* Installation

Fetch the archive either from releases or from the development branch, extract
it and put =hddtemp-lt= under =/usr/local/bin/=. In case you downloaded the
script alone from github by a raw link, be sure to manually make it executable.

* How to provide smartctl output samples

No serial numbers, no time:

#+begin_example
  sudo smartctl -q noserial -i -A -l scttempsts /dev/sda | grep -v 'Local Time is'
#+end_example
